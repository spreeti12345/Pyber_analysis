The purpose of this written report for Data Analyst at PyBer is to create a complete summary of the Ride-Sharing data by city type. And determine mean, median, and mode using Pandas, NumPy, and SciPy statistics. Our Final Analysis include multiple-line graphs of total weekly fares for each city type.

## Summary </br>
On the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types:1) From our analysis, we can predict that there are good opportunities to expand the business in rural and suburban cities, including hiring drivers to operate and explode business in rural and suburban cities.

2) The Urban cities fare is the highest and consistent,opening business opportunities to expand rides, create rides and experiment with other discounts/ ideas to maintain a steady customer base.

3) The Rural cities fare is the lowest of the other two city types (Urban and Suburban cities), in addition, fares never intersect. Knowing that all fares never intersect, we can expand fares and increase business financial income to the company without affecting city rates.
